# Dubins Path Simulator
A simulation for finding the optimal path of UAS drone given turning radius and waypoint coordinates

## What are Dubin's paths
- Basically just the shortest path from one orientation & position to another orientation & position for a vehicle that can only move forward and also has a minimum turning radius
- Two types of Dubin's paths: CSC (curve + straight line + curve) and CCC (curve + curve + curve)

## How code works
(As of Feb 13): Randomly generates a theoretical drone/waypoint position/orientation and calculates the RSR path. New waypoints can be generated by the user, in which the drone will be updated to the previous waypoint's position & orientation

*note: since I've only found the RSR paths so far, if two points are generated really close to each other (requiring a CCC path), the program might bug out. Just make another waypoint :)

## The math (it's really long lol, only look at it if you really want to)
