# Dubins Path Simulator
A simulation for finding the optimal path of UAS drone given turning radius and waypoint coordinates  

## How it works
Randomly generates a theoretical drone/waypoint position/orientation and calculates the optimal Dubins path. New waypoints can be generated by the user, in which the drone will be updated to the previous waypoint's position & orientation. Slider exists to play around with minimum turning radius

## About Dubins paths
- [Dubins paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubins_path) are the shortest path from one orientation & position to another orientation & position for a vehicle that can only move forward and also has a minimum turning radius
- Here's a good visualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEImNJQ3hUM 
- Two types of Dubin's paths: CSC (curve + straight line + curve) and CCC (curve + curve + curve)
